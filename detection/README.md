# attention
Considering that this article is currently under review, the core code associated with our research will be released upon the article's acceptance.

# description
This is the code based on the YOLOv8, https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics, please reference YOLOv8.

The install pipeline can be found in YOLOv8, our requirement of CMBs-YOLO is same as YOLOv8.

Train CMD: python train.py, you should modify some configurations in train.py to meet your dataset.

Prediction CMD: python prediction.py, you should modify some configurations in prediction.py to meet your dataset.

We warmly welcome pointing out any bugs in the code.
